# Census-Data-Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analysis of a mock census dataset designed to replicate the structure of the 1881 UK census. The dataset provides insights into the townâ€™s demographics, occupations, and household structures, aiding in strategic decision-making for infrastructure, housing, and investment.
